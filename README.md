# Day-2-Agent-Tools-Interoperability-with-Model-Context-Protocol-MCP-

During the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, I explored the Agent tools interoperability with MCP by completing codelabs on Kaggle.

Day 2a - Agent Tools

Day 2b - Agent Tools Best Practices

What I learnt during the 2nd day,

1. Learned how agents use tools and how to design custom tool functions.
2. Implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent interoperability and long-running tool operations.
3. Created Python functions to extend agent capabilities and experimented with pausing/resuming tasks for human approval.
